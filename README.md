Climate change presentation 

The earth climates is changing very fast and differently nowadays climate changes in our earth are affecting our lives psychologically, physically and emotionally. some see it as a natural occurrence and others see it as a man made catastrophe, the fact is simple that the world climate is changing
What is climate change? Climate change is the seasonal changes for a long period of time in the world. The climate patterns effect our economies and ecosystems For example, the changes in climate can affect how people, plants and animal live, such as food production and health risks. 

the earth’s climate is very broad and always changing causing a good deal concern for us as humans.However, what are the causes and effects of climate changes that affecting our lives and environment?

There are two main causes of climate changes – natural causes and human activities. Natural causes have influenced the earth’s climates such as volcanic eruptions, ocean current, the earth’s orbital changes and solar variations.


All the causes are giving a great impact for climate changes in our earth.the consequences We can see that there are three main effects on climate changes in our environment. Firstly, climate change in the world affects human health. There are so many past researches showed that climate change will leads to human health and producing diseases.
Secondly, climate changes will also affect the biodiversity. Biodiversity is very important for the plants and animals to maintain their habitat and ecosystem. The climate changes have impacted the loss of biodiversity.

When we have a look at our Neutral occurrence sentiment graph each of these topics are becoming more and more relevant each day and rightfully so.This has made the “#climate” thee most talked about topic on the news and social media 

Trump once said “Nobody really knows if it [climate change] is real as we can see in our anti class graph he is number one in trends.This has proved to be untrue according to a survey, over 97% of scientists say that climate change was mostly if not all man made.The president of the U.S went as far as branding it’s former president Mr Obama’s climate change legacy as “stupid”.The Obama rule was devised to shut down hundreds of heavily polluting coal-fired power plants and freeze construction of new coal plants, while replacing them with vast wind and solar farms.
Which sounded like a great idea to me.These series of tweets lands him on our highest trend on our anti graph


Discussion 

The causes and effects of climate change are very clear at this point but what can we do? Firstly, the government can help the communities and businesses to reduce deforestation, plant new trees in the forest and empty land, earn sustainable livelihoods and adapt to changing climatic conditions. Next, teachers in lecturers in schools and tertiaries must give the knowledge of how to protect our earth from the very young age of the children and students. One of the reasons that caused the climate changes is the emission of carbon dioxide from the vehicles. Also, our famous political leaders  and news channels also have to remove themselves from the anti class and lead by example.
We ourselves can reduce the uses of vehicles and car-pooling in our daily lives.You can start practicing at home by switching off any electrical appliances when not in use this will help conserve energy 

Conclusion 
 there are many effects of climate changes that seriously affecting our environment, health and biodiversities. If we still have not take any actions to prevent the climate changes, our mother earth will be become sick more seriously.If not there will be serious environmental concerns . We need to protect our environment and give our next generation to have a better place to stay, we must always know how to prevent the climate changes such as stop cutting off the trees, save energy, car-pooling, etc. Therefore, let us keep our Mother Earth healthy
